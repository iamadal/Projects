Project outline

1.1 This is our homepage. it will show login system along with menu shown in the top bar
1.2 Price/Bill Calculator. This is a simple price calculator. 
      (Type-1): see priceCalc_1.png  N.B: No need to save data.
      (Type-2): see priceCalc_2.png  N.B: Need data saving option so that user can access it by selecting the date, row should be dynamic so that rows can be added or removed
                user can add whole table and at the bottom of the table total bill will be displayed.
     
1.3 Duty Plan: This is a Very Simple App. We have 9 regular table boys to serve food in the following canteen. (see canteenList.png)
    Each table boy work 8 hours in one shift. if they work both shift they get paid 400TK[same method is applicable for table boys who would like to work at their holidays]
    Also we hire table boys in outsourcing method. They are called ন.হা if they work one shift they get paid 400Tk for 
    both shift they get paid 600TK

    We need an input form like canteenList.png also a seperate list for tracking CL for Table boys.
    from CL list identify off days and and generate report
    
    Procedure.(see canteenList.png and canteenReport.png )
    
    fn.findTotalSeat(int seat, int participants): array
       * seat         = sum(2nd_column)  -- canteenList.png
       * participants = sum(4th_column)  --- canteenList.png 
       * number_of_table_boys = celing(participants/35) 
       * number_of_people_for_dishwash = celing(participants/100) - this applicable for all(excluding Table Boys)
         
	return an array containing number of table_boys, people_for_dishwash and other required for the canteen each day
	see canteenReport.png

    fn.estimation(food_item: string, quantity: int): array
       1. findOrFail = loop_up_database(food_item: string ): bool
       2. if(findOrFail):
             ingredient[] = fetchItem(food_item)
             calculate_the_required_ingredients
             iflour = flour*quantity
             iOil   = Oil*quantity
             iSalt  = iSalt*quantity
             update_purchase_list(array of ingredients)
             return the ingredients array and push it on the Bazar list
 
         else:
           redirect to add food item page

      
     Sample input: Bread for 5 People
     Sample Output: Flouer = 0.5*5  = 2.5KG
                    Oil    = 0.1*5  = 0.5KG
                    Salt   = 0.05*5 = 0.25KG

    Interface_2: read food menu as string connected by plus sing and Number of Person (see Menu.png)
        fn.purseFoodItem(itemList: string, quatity: int): void
           menu = itemlist.split('+')
